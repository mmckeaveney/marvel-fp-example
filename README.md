# marvel-fp-example
Interactions with the Marvel comics API using only pure functional constructs. You can pass in several superheroes as command line arguments, and the app will show you all the marvel comic book series that they appear together in.

This little example shows the power of using pure functional programming constructs instead vs mutable and imperative logic. Both of these applications do exactly the same thing, however the code could not be more different.

Run the application by doing the following - 

## Setup
- Get your API keys from - https://developer.marvel.com/
- Once you have your keys, add them to a file called keys.js in the root of the directory. It is important they are named correctly. Here's a template - 
```
const MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY = "yourPrivateKeyHere";
const MARVEL_API_KEY = "yourPublicKeyHere";

module.exports = {
    MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY,
    MARVEL_API_KEY
};
```
- cd into the app you want to use - (imperative, functional)
- perform an 
``` npm/yarn install ```

## Running
eg. ``` node index.js Hulk Spider-Man Deadpool ```


##Â Output
```
